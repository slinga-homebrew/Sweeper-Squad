# Sweeper Squad
Sweeper Squad is a 12-player Minesweeper clone for the Sega Saturn. Requires two [6 Player Adaptors](https://segaretro.org/Saturn_6_Player_Adaptor) for full twelve player support. Requires a modded Saturn or another method to get code running on actual hardware. Build the code with Jo Engine or grab an ISO from [releases](https://github.com/slinga-homebrew/Sweeper-Squad/releases).

Sweeper Squad was my entry to the [Sega Saturn 29th Anniversary Game Competition](https://segaxtreme.net/threads/sega-saturn-29th-anniversary-game-competition.25411/).
